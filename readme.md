# Beginner JavaScript

These are the starter files and solutions to the [Beginner JavaScript](https://BeginnerJavaScript.com) course

## Module 1: The Basics

### 03: Running & Loading JavaScript

- Adding `async` to a `script` tag will tell it to load asynchronously
- Adding `defer` to a `script` tag will tell it to wait until everything else is loaded first

### 05: Code Quality Tooling With Prettier and ESLint

- [Wes Bos's ESLint Config](https://github.com/wesbos/eslint-config-wesbos)

### 08: Types - Numbers

- `typeof` to get type
- Plus sign will concatenate strings so be careful
- `Math.` helper methods are useful. `round`, `floor`, `random` and `ceil` are most commonly used
- The Modulo `%` will give you the remainder of one number divided by another
- Don't store money in dollars and cents, just use cents and round it
- Integers are whole numbers and floats have decimal points

### 10: Null and Undefined

- `undefined` is when you try to access a variable that has been created but not set to any value
- `null` is when a variable has a value explicitly set to nothing

### 11: Booleans an Equality

- Almost always use triple equals
- Triple equals checks for the value and type of the things being compared
- Double equals only checks the value of the things being compared

## Module 2: Functions

### 12: Functions - Built-In

- `navigator.vibrate` can vibrate phones
- `scrollTo` can scroll to a section of a page
