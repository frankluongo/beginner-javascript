NYC — The ultimate guide for moving to New York City, written and designed   for creatives.

■ PROJECT: LETSGOTO.nyc
■ ROLE: creative director & author
■ BUY: GET THE EBOOK HERE

Moving to New York from Austria was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I figured most of it out the hard way: finding a job, getting a visa, choosing an apartment. Seven years later and still happily living in the city, I wrote a book that makes it easier for others. Let’s Go to NYC is the complete guide for moving to New York from outside the States. It’s the sum of my personal experience, legal advice and tons of research all in one place, written in easy-to-understand terms. No bullshit, no fluff.

Unsplash  —  Capturing the spirit of exploration in a limited edition, custom-designed   sweatshirt.

■ PROJECT: SELF-INITIATED
■ ROLE: DESIGNER, PHOTOGRAPHER
■ SHOP THE SWEATSHIRT HERE

Together with my friends at Unsplash, I created a sweatshirt that embodies our shared love of travel and exploration. I designed each detail of the sweatshirt, from the label on the sleeve to the graphic in tonal black foil script on the front. The Urban Explorer sweatshirt is handmade in Canada from 100% french terry cotton and reads “Fernweh & Wanderlust.” In German, Fernweh translates to “farsickness” or “longing for far-off places.”

NXTGlobe  —  Using innovative technology to imagine a perfect world without gasoline cars.

■ AGENCY: FANTASY INTERACTIVE
■ ROLE: ART DIRECTOR & LEAD DESIGNER
▸ DEMO: VIEW VIDEO

A leading car brand created Eco Next Globe to show how the world would look if we switched from gasoline to eco-friendly cars. Using WebGL technology, I art directed and designed the experience. The website used real map data to generate a visual dashboard for each user, all elements rendering directly in the browser. Everything was built with new web technology – even buttons and subtle glow effects were completely coded in CSS or integrated via SVG.

.Mail —   Rethinking the way email works with a refreshingly simple email client concept.

■ PROJECT: DOTMAIL APP
■ ROLE: FOUNDER, DESIGNER
■ DATE: 2011 (NEVER LAUNCHED)


While technology had advanced and adapted to our needs over the years, email hadn't evolved much at all. I created the DotMail email concept to fix that problem. Unlike many email clients filled with functionality nobody needs, DotMail focused on only the necessities. With a clean, visual interface and simple yet revolutionary details like Actionsteps, DotMail gained a surprising amount of attention and even press from publications like Fast Company.

Black Marble —  A limited edition beard oil, custom-designed  for you and those close to you.

■ PROJECT: BLACK MARBlE
■ ROLE: ART DIRECTOR & DESIGNER
■ DATE: 2014

I partnered with Beard Brand to design a premium beard oil from scratch, carefully refining the formula and designing the packaging, brand and marketing. Tired of the typical woodsy scent of most beard oils, we aimed for a more subtle fragrance using citrus, cedarwood and ginger. I’m biased, but I’d say it’s the best beard oil out there. The beard approves this message.

What began as a side project in 2011 quickly reached cult status, with millionS of downloads across Android and iOS shortly after launch.

Aquatilis  —  Using interactive storytelling to share the journey of an undersea expedition.

■ CLIENT: AQUATILIS
■ ROLE: CREATIVE DIRECTOR & DESIGN
■ DEMO: VIEW WEBSITE

A team of explorers were embarking on a three-year journey to explore the world’s oceans — and they needed an equally immersive website. The website i designed told their story with an interactive scrolling experience and subtle animations uncommon for that time. To mine and the Aquatilis team’s excitement, the site got a ton of press and inspired many to create similar editorial layouts.

I've been fortunate enough to be featured in highly acclaimed publications such as .net Magazine, Computer Arts,  FastCompany, Wired, Inc Magazine, FirstRound Capital, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, Business Insider and many others.
